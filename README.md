# Cfx.re Artifacts Updater

A bundle of scripts to easily update your Cfx.re (FiveM/RedM) server artifacts.

This was formerly just a PHP script but since not everyone has PHP installed on their systems I decided to convert to PowerShell and Shell.

The usage is the same in any script: `./file.extension (recommended/optional/[latest]/critical)` with the default for no version argument passed being "latest"

Just leave one of these scripts outside of your artifacts folder, that you _should_ be using for all your servers.

- fivem
  - update-artifacts.ext

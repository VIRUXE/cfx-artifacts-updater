# Cfx.re Artifacts Updater
A bundle of scripts to easily update your Cfx.re (FiveM/RedM) server artifacts.

This was formerly just a PHP script but since not everyone has PHP installed on their systems I decided to convert to PowerShell and Shell.

The usage is the same in any script: `./file.extension recommended/optional/latest/critical` with the default for no version argument passed being "latest"
